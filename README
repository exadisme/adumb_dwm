This is my personal DWM build.
It contains multiple patches of which I cannot entirely recall. 
I am sure it contains pertag, vanity gaps, system tray, autostartscript and various layouts

Please check the config.h for layouts.
A few layouts are defined however I only have some binded.

I have built in my own keybinds. You will want to change them for your needs.

The tag icons depend on the fontawesome package. You may install through your package manager if available or use:
https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome

For autostart script, you can create a script in ~/.dwm/autostart,sh 
Don't forget to make it executable.
Example:

#!/bin/sh
xset s 600 600 &
xss-lock --transfer-sleep-lock slock &
picom --experimental-backends &
dunst &

dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
